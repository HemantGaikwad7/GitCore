## High-Level Architecture Summary

This project implements a simplified version control system, resembling Git, written in Python. It consists of two main files: `Git.py` which contains the core logic of the Git-like system, and `helloworld.py`, which is a simple example file used for testing and demonstration purposes.

### 1. `Git.py`

**Role:**

This file contains the core implementation of the version control system. It handles the initialization of a repository, adding files to the staging area, creating commits, displaying commit history, showing repository status, and displaying differences between commits.

**Interactions:**

*   **`helloworld.py`:** Serves as a target file for version control operations (add, commit, etc.) within the simulated Git environment.
*   **File System:** Interacts heavily with the file system to create directories (`.git/objects`), read and write files (objects, index, HEAD), and manage repository metadata.
*   **Standard Libraries:** Utilizes standard libraries like `os`, `json`, `hashlib`, `argparse`, `datetime`, `pathlib`, `difflib` and `typing` for file system operations, JSON serialization/deserialization, SHA-1 hashing, command-line argument parsing, date/time handling, path manipulation, calculating and displaying differences, and type hints respectively.

**Structure:**

*   **`Colors` Class:**  A utility class defining ANSI color codes for terminal output, enhancing the user experience by providing colored output for diffs and status messages.
*   **`Git` Class:**
    *   **`__init__`:** Initializes the `Git` object with the repository path and sets up paths for `.git` directory, objects, HEAD, and index.
    *   **`init`:** Creates the `.git` directory and necessary files (HEAD, index) to initialize a new repository.
    *   **`hash_object`:**  Calculates the SHA-1 hash of a file's content.
    *   **`get_object_path`:**  Determines the path where an object (file content or commit data) should be stored within the `.git/objects` directory.  It uses the first two characters of the hash as a subdirectory for organization.
    *   **`add`:**  Adds a file to the staging area by hashing its content, storing it as an object, and updating the `index` file.
    *   **`update_staging_area`:** Updates the `index` file (staging area) with the file's path and hash. The `index` is stored as a JSON file.
    *   **`commit`:** Creates a commit by reading the staging area, creating commit metadata (timestamp, message, files, parent commit), hashing the commit data, storing it as an object, updating the `HEAD` file, and clearing the staging area.
    *   **`get_current_head`:** Retrieves the hash of the current HEAD commit.
    *   **`log`:** Displays the commit history by traversing the commit chain starting from the HEAD.
    *   **`status`:** Shows the current status of the repository by comparing the staging area with the working directory.
    *   **`show_commit_diff`:** Shows the differences introduced by a specific commit.
    *   **`show_diff`:** Displays a colored diff between two strings using `difflib`.
    *   **`get_parent_file_content`:** Retrieves the content of a file from a parent commit, enabling diffs across commits.
    *   **`get_commit_data`:** Retrieves commit data (metadata) based on a commit hash.
    *   **`get_file_content`:** Retrieves the content of a file based on its hash.
*   **`main` Function:**  Parses command-line arguments using `argparse` and calls the appropriate `Git` class methods to execute the requested command (init, add, commit, log, status, show).

**Design Choices:**

*   **Simplified Object Storage:**  Stores objects (file contents and commit data) as plain text files within the `.git/objects` directory, using SHA-1 hashes for content addressing.  This is a simplified approach compared to Git's compressed object storage.
*   **JSON-based Index:**  Uses a JSON file (`index`) to represent the staging area, storing file paths and their corresponding hashes.
*   **Linear Commit History:**  Supports only a linear commit history (no branching or merging).  The `parent` field in the commit data points to the previous commit.
*   **No Compression:** Does not implement any compression techniques for storing objects, which is a significant difference from Git's efficient storage mechanisms.

### 2. `helloworld.py`

**Role:**

This file serves as a simple example file that can be added to the version control system, committed, and used to demonstrate the functionality of the `Git.py` script.

**Interactions:**

*   **`Git.py`:**  The `Git.py` script's `add` command reads and hashes the contents of `helloworld.py`, and its `commit` command records changes made to `helloworld.py`.

**Structure:**

*   A simple loop that prints "Hello World!" 10 times.

In summary, the `Git.py` file is the core component, implementing the simplified version control logic. The `helloworld.py` file acts as a sample target file for the version control operations. The system utilizes standard libraries for file system interaction, hashing, command-line argument parsing, and displaying differences.  The design prioritizes simplicity over advanced features like branching, merging, and efficient storage.
